# VRaptor Thymeleaf

## Requirements

This project was built using:

- [JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Thymeleaf 3.0.11](https://www.thymeleaf.org/documentation.html)

## Attaching the library to your project

Since `1.0.1` you do not need to provide a thymeleaf version in your project.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>br.com.faroltech.vraptor</groupId>
  <artifactId>vraptor-thymeleaf</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Just put your thymeleaf templates in `WEB-INF/templates` and you are good to go!
